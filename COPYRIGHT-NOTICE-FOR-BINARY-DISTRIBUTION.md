GEM (a.k.a. Good Enough Menu) - Arduino library for creation of graphic multi-level menu with  
editable menu items, such as variables (supports int, byte, float, double, boolean, char[17] data types)  
and option selects. User-defined callback function can be specified to invoke when menu item is saved.

Supports buttons that can invoke user-defined actions and create action-specific  
context, which can have its own enter (setup) and exit callbacks as well as loop function.

Supports:
- AltSerialGraphicLCD library by Jon Green (<http://www.jasspa.com/serialGLCD.html>);
- U8g2 library by olikraus (<https://github.com/olikraus/U8g2_Arduino>);
- Adafruit GFX library by Adafruit (<https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library>).
